This research and working towards my degree has been an endeavor and one that I would not dream of tackling on my own.

Firstly, my thanks go to God, the ultimate creator, who formed us all to be creators fitting our skills.

Second, much gratitude goes to my very creative and patient family. I am thankful for my husband, Chris, who was foundational in finding the time and focus on working on my studies. My amazing kids, Ewan and Gwynnie, have provided patience, encouragement, and numerous trips to the library. I could not have gotten through this without all of your support.

Finally, I am grateful for my coworkers and my professors. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at Sysco has been cheering me on from the sidelines. The professors at Lewis University have provided mentorship and guidance. They have all encouraged me as I've worked to apply my knowledge from the last decade of my experience as a software developer and gather new information that has helped us build better software solutions.
