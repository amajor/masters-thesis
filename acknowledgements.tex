This research and working towards my degree has been an endeavor, and one that I would not dream to tackle on my own.

Firstly, my thanks goes to God, the ultimate creator, who formed us all to be creators fitting to our own skills.

Second, there is much gratitude that goes to my very creative and patient family. To my husband, Chris, who was foundational in finding time and focus to work on my studies. And to my amazing kids, Ewan and Gwynnie, who provided patience, encouragement, and bountiful trips to the library. I couldn't have gotten through this without all of your support.

Finally, to my coworkers and my professors. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at Sysco has been cheering me on from the sidelines. The professors at Lewis Univeristy have provided mentorship and guidance. They have all encouraged me as I've worked to apply my knowledge from the last decade of my experience as a software developer and gather new information that has helped us all to build better software solutions.
