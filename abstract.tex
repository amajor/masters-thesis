% State the problem.
Some software engineering projects fail to evolve, which makes them obsolete.
% Say why this problem is interesting.
This topic is interesting and important to developers because the software that fails to evolve will fail to generate user engagement, leading to revenue loss.
% Say what my solution achieves.
We review a number of projects and resources to understand the correlation of software structure quality and its impacts on a system's ability to evolve.
% Say what follows from my solution.
With this understanding, we explore ways to improve the evolution of a software system through tools and suggestions.

% When writing an abstract, bare in mind an abstract is a short descriptive summary of your thesis. The number of words accepted might vary e.g. 200-250 words. An MS thesis abstract need not exceed two pages. Abstracts are typically written last although they are the most important part of the thesis. They should have a little bit of everything: the background, the scope of your project, the purpose, findings and conclusions. An abstract is neither paragraphed nor cited. It should not be written as a literature review or a discussion of results. In a simplistic manner, your abstract, in a few words, should answer the questions: why should we care about your research; how did you get your results; what did you learn, find, create, invent; and finally what do your results imply?
