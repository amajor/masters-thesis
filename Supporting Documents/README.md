### [Enabling Empirical Research: A Corpus of Large-Scale Python Systems](./conference_041818.pdf)

> The Python programming language has been pick- ing up traction in Industry for the past few years in virtually all application domains. Python is known for its high calibre and passionate community of developers. Empirical research on Python systems has potential to promote a healthy environment, where claims and beliefs held by the community are supported by data. To facilitate such research, a corpus of 132 open source python projects have been identified, basic information, quality as well as complexity metrics has been collected and organized into CSV files. Collectively, the list consists of 36, 635 python modules, 59, 532 classes, 253, 954 methods and 84, 892 functions. Projects in the selected list span various application domains including Web/APIs, Scientific Computing, Security and more.

### [A Large-Scale Study of Programming Languages and Code Quality in GitHub](./baishakhi17.pdf)

> What is the effect of programming languages on software quality? This question has been a topic of much debate for a very long time. In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (728 projects, 63 million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static versus dynamic typing and allowing versus disallowing type confusion on software quality. By triangulat- ing findings from different methods, and controlling for con- founding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a signifi- cant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that disallowing type confusion is modestly better than allowing it, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat bet- ter than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelm- ingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, for example, the prefer- ence of certain personality types for functional, static lan- guages that disallow type confusion.
