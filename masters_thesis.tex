The art of programming begin as something quite frankly tedious and error prone, with programmers writing every step of a process in a machine language. As this was not a great way to grow the industry, languages were developed so that programmers could reduce the manual effort of their programming and also improve the quality of their work by allowing the machine itself to transform the high-level code into something executable and efficient. \cite{lehman:1980}

``Of the total U.S. expenditure for 1977, some 70 percent was spent on program maintenance and only about 30 percent on program development.'' \cite{lehman:1980}

``The unit cost of change must initially be made as low as possible and its growth, as the system ages, minimized. Programs must be made more alterable, and the alterability maintained throughout their lifetime. The change process itself must be planned and controlled.'' \cite{lehman:1980}

  \label{figEPrograms}
\end{figure}

The programs we write become part of the world around that it models. These programs, especially with the advent of mobile technology, have become embedded in our world. Lehman recognized this decades ago and acknowledged the relationship of these types of programs to our world, as seen in Fig. \ref{figEPrograms}. \cite{lehman:1980}

``As they become familiar with a system whose design and attributes depend at least in part on user attitudes and practice before system installation, users will modify their behavior to minimize effort or maximize effectiveness.'' \cite{lehman:1980}

``Software Maintainability is an indispensable factor to acclaim for the quality of particular software. It describes the ease to perform several maintenance activities to make a software adaptable to the modified environment. The availability \& growing popularity of a wide range of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data analysis further provides the motivation for predicting this maintainability.'' \cite{gupta:2021}

``This study would open new doors for the software developers for carrying out comparatively more precise predictions well in time and hence reduce the overall maintenance costs.'' \cite{gupta:2021}

``A significant proportion of the comprehensive cost of software during the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is spent in the maintenance phase alone since the cost of maintenance keeps on accumulating with each phase of SDLC. It has been observed that only 30-40\% of the resources, including money, time, and effort, are utilized in the development phase, whereas the remaining 60-70\% is used for the maintenance activities [1].'' \cite{gupta:2021}

``There exists a detailed standard for software quality known as ISO/IEC 25010:2011. It describes eight product quality characteristics, where each characteristic further comprises various sub-related characteristics [2]. Fig. 1 depicts these eight quality characteristics, along with the sub characteristics. Of all the quality characteristics, maintainability is considered for evaluation in the current study since it is one of the most significant characteristics.''

See ``Fig.~\ref{figProductQualityModel}'' which comes from ISO/IEC 25010:2011 \cite{iso/iec:25010:2011} (already referenced in this paper).

``Software maintainability these days has become one of the essential external attributes of software, which further forms a basis of research for many researchers working in the fields related to software engineering. Software maintainability can be described as the extent to which a particular software system can be changed concerning the number of Lines of Code (LOC).'' \cite{gupta:2021}

``Software maintainability is one of the fundamental external quality attributes and is recognised as a research area of primary concern in software engineering.'' \cite{alsolai:2019}

``There are ten software maintainability measurements used in selected primary studies: CHANGE maintenance effort, corrective maintenance, adaptive maintenance effort, maintenance evaluation by maintainability index, maintenance evaluation by change proneness, maintenance time, maintenance cost, maintenance attributes, maintenance components and other measurements.'' \cite{alsolai:2019}

There have been studies done to help visualize the evolution of software through the use of city maps. \cite{steinbruckner:2012}

The EvoStreets approach follows 3 models to build up the map:
1. The **primary model** for software cities captures structural and analysis data.
    - Structural data refer to the static software structure, i.e. the decomposition into subsystems and modules, as well as dependencies among modules.
2. The secondary model is a 2.5D **geometric model**, representing primary model data
    - captures the main structural and evolutionary properties of the software system
    - provides a specific, stable gestalt for each software system
      - mainly influenced by the particular layout of the system elements
3. **Thematic tertiary models**
    - designed to support specific application scenarios by visualizing particular aspects of a given software system and its development history
