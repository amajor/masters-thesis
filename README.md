# The Impact of Structural Quality on Software Evolution

This paper will investigate how well the Pylint score (more specifically, the Refactor score) measures a system's structural quality. To do this, we will analyze the correlation between the Refactor score and the ease of adding features to the system.

Good architecture takes into account maintainability. The effort to make a feature work should be easy and localized in maintainable projects. We will measure locality by the number of files edited in a commit. We will focus on commits that represent new features rather than bug fixes.

## Goal

This paper will review how structural quality can impact software evolution.
