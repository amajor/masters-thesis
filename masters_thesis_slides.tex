  \frametitle{Introduction}
  \textbf{Maintainability Index and Refactor Scores}
  \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Areas of concern: cost, timeline, quality
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Quality is hard to understand
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Pylint \& Radon are a static analysis tools
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Refactor violations point out code smells
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Introduction Notes ----------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When we build new software solutions, there are several categories that we consider during planning.
      \item Namely, COST, TIME-TO-DELIVER, and also, often to a slightly smaller extent, QUALITY.
      \item Though quality can be a factor we consider when planning a project, it is a hard characteristic to understand and measure.
      \item There are a number of tools available for enforcing standards, some built into IDEs (like Visual Studio Code) and others as 3rd party linter tools.
      \item Two such tools are Pylint and Radon, which can be used to analyze Python projects.
      \item In particular, we will focus on the REFACTOR violations that are noted in the code reports from Pylint and Radon, as these warnings can lead us to code smells.
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Keeping Users Engaged Long Term}
  \textbf{Why does software evolution matter?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Users find bugs
    \item Users want new features
    \item New security threats
    \item New laws from governing bodies
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  Need a thriving community of engaged users in order to keep apps and games successful.

  \vspace{0.35cm}
  In an open source system, need a thriving community of engaged developers in order to continue evolving.
\end{frame}

% ----- Keeping Users Engaged Notes -------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sometimes ``evolution'' is just a matter of maintenance and fixing bugs that users find.
      \item However, if users are engaged and actively using software, they are going to push the software to its limits and they will want new features.
      \item We want this kind of engagement, because it means that we have users, which, depending on your business model, means that your software can be profitable.
      \item Over time, there can also be new security threats and new laws that require software to be updated.
      \item These different forces will all drive software evolution; otherwise a system will become unused and deprecated.
    \end{itemize}
  }
}

% =============================================================================

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Keeping Users Engaged Long Term}
  \textbf{How do we ensure software evolution?}

  \vspace{0.35cm}
  Keep the project maintainable.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bugs should be quick and easy to fix
    \item New features should be easy to add
    \item Consistent standards (naming, small methods, etc)
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \textbf{Software Maintenance}
  \newline Large portion of project cost in a typical software system is in the maintenance phase.
\end{frame}

% ----- Keepign Users Engaged Pt. 2 Notes ------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item So how do we make sure that our projects that we plan to build will evolve?
      \item We need to make sure the project stays maintainable.
      Bugs and new features should be easy to handle
      \item Part of what allows for easy changes is having consistent standards.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Naming conventions
        \item Keeping methods small
        \item Having organized files
      \end{itemize}
      \item The majority of a typical project's cost lies not in the development phase, but in the maintenance phase!
      \item Maintenance is an important part of a software solutions lifecycle; we cannot ignore it as we plan!
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{The Impact of Structural Quality}
  \textbf{Measuring Maintainability}
  \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Easy to maintain = Easy to evolve
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Pylint \& Radon Maintainability Index (MI)

    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item PEP 8 is a set of Python standards

    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Refactor Messages (Pylint)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Refactor warnings are generally ``code smells''
      \item Code smells point out problems in Architecture
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Measuring Maintainability Notes ---------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If we want to keep our projects easy to maintain so that they are easy to evolve, how do we MEASURE that maintainability?
      \item Pylint and Radon are tools I mentioned earlier that provide a measurement known as the Maintainability Index.
      \item You can get this value from several different tools, all using the same standard equation with slight modifications.
      \item In Pylint's reports, they also provide a number of different messages: 
      \newline Convention, Error, Fatal, Information, Refactor, Warning
      \item These types of messages are defined using PEP 8, which is a collection of Python standards than can be used as a list of ``best practices''
      \item Today we focus on the refactor messages with the data we collected, as they will generally lead us to ``code smells'', which are problems in the software's architecture.
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \frametitle{The Impact of Structural Quality}
  \textbf{Other Maintainability Characteristics}
  \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Low coupling, high cohesion
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Readability
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Big commits reduce maintainability
      \item PEP 8 enforces readability
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Confidence that metrics around software structure provide value in keeping systems maintainable (and therefore can evolve) % \cite{zhou:2020}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Other Maintainability Characteristics Notes ---------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Refactor warnings aren't the only only thing we should care about for good maintainability.
      \item We should also remember other good practices, like low coupling and high cohesion.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Coupling refers to the degree to which different modules depend on each other (we want modules to be independent from each other; separate; low coupling)
        \item and cohesion refers to the degree in which elements of a module belong together (we want to bind related code together; high cohesion)
      \end{itemize}
      \item We also want good readability (big commits can be hard to follow, as well as big files with a lot of code).
      \item PEP 8 standards enforce readability.
      \item And having confidence around the metrics that tools like Pylint and Radon can offer should be able to help us keep our systems maintainable.

  \textbf{Documentation and Maintainability}
  \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Documentation holds the results of significant design decisions
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Can influence the ability to evolve because\dots
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Enhances code understanding
      \item Comprehensibility impacts maintainability in a positive way  
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Documentation and Maintainability Notes ------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item To add to the ideas of maintainability and readable code, we should also remember that documentation can feed into our success in the quality of our architecture.
      \item When we build a software system, good documentation can hold significant design decisions.
      \item This ``historical record'' can help developers in the open source community understand the code and why things are the way they are.
      \item Better comprehension makes it easier to maintain and evolve the code.
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Related Work}
  \textbf{Design Patterns and Software Quality}
  \begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Design patterns provide flexibility
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Classes with frequent changes are either...
    \begin{itemize}
      \vspace{0.15cm} 
      \item Easy to extend (okay)
      \vspace{0.15cm} 
      \newline ...or...
      \vspace{0.15cm}
      \item Correlate to other classes (high coupling... red flag!)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item We look at refactor score (code smell) not error score (bugs)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.35cm}
  Keeping this in mind, we focus on \emph{changes for system extensions and adaptiation}, not bug fixes.
\end{frame}

% ----- Design Patterns & Software Quality Notes ------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Through our studies, we also know that design patterns can lead us to better ways to build our code, which provides us with more flexibility.
      \item As we review open source systems, finding code classes with frequent changes generally mean one of two things\dots
      \begin{itemize}
        \item the class is easy to extend (which is good!) (low coupling)
        \item or the class is highly coupled (highly tied) to other classes which means updating one requires updates to another (code smell!)
      \end{itemize}
      \item Keeping this in mind, we again are reminded to steer towards understanding the frequency of refactor messages, or code smells, that we get from Pylint.
      \item We are less concerned with error scores, which are just bugs and not an indicator of how maintainable the code is. 
    \end{itemize}

% ----- Related Work Notes ----------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item With all of these attributes and characteristics we’ve discussed, we can boil a lot of this down to the product quality model that the committee of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission has provided us with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Maintainability (our topic of interest)
        \item Extensibility
        \item Keeping things simple
        \item Keeping things reusable
        \item Focusing on performance 
        \item etc.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Helping developers keep these in mind when adding or changing code will allow for easier FUTURE development.
      \item This all comes back to maintainability (our structural quality) and its impact on software evolution.

  \frametitle{Methodology}
  \textbf{Initial Repository Set}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Popular
    \item Long development history
    \item Multiple release cycles
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.35cm}
  \textbf{Filtered Respository Set}
  
  \emph{At least 80\% Python code and top 20th percentile in these categories:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Long history of commits (2,968+ commits)
    \item Large number of contributors (90+ contributors)
    \item Many releases (44+ releases)
    \item Substantial Age (66.4+ months)
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.35cm}
  Results in 46 repositories for further research.
\end{frame}

% ----- Methodology Notes -----------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Now we're ready for the data!
      \item We started with a larger set of open source python projects on GitHub that were popular (lots of stars), had a long commit history, and contained multiple release cycles.
      \item That set was collected from an earlier study conducted by Dr. Omari and other colleagues.
      \item From there, we filtered the set down to any projects that contained at least 80\% Python code.
      \item And finally, we found the top 20th percentile in several key categories.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Long history of commits (2,968+)
        \item Large number of contributors (90+)
        \item Many releases (44+)
        \item Substantial age (66.4+ months … over 5.5 years!)
      \end{itemize}
      \item This left us with 46 repositories for deeper study.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Radon MI for all repositories rank as grade ``A''
    \newline which is considered ``very high maintainability''
    \item Open source systems with engaged community 
    \newline of developers tend to have higher scores
    \item For comparison, calculated ratio of refactor message count 
    \newline to SLOC as well as the average MI for a project.

\end{frame}

% ----- Results Notes ---------------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item With our smaller data set on hand, we ran Radon against each repository to gain a Maintainability Index.
      \item For a very simplified view, we averaged the Maintainability Index of all files within each project.
      \item This gave us a single number for general comparison with each repository.
      \item This calculated value is shown in the ``Avg MI'' column.
      \item In Radon's grading system, any value over 20 is considered ``very maintainable'' code.
      \item We also used a count of the Pylint REFACTOR messages and calculated the ratio of messages to source-line-of-code for an idea of how many code smells each project contained, relative to its size.
      \item This calculated ratio is shown in the “Ratio” column.
      \item Listed in the table are the ``best 3'' (cython, youtube-dl, and electrum) and the ``worst 3'' (raven-python, scrapy, and numba) in regards to their refactor ratios.

% ----- Results Pt. 2 Notes ---------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item With this information, we can get an idea of where these projects stand in regards to their refactor message ratios compared to each other.
      \item This histogram shows that the majority of our repository set have a very low ratio of refactor messages.
      \item This could indicate that our projects are all highly maintainable based on our assumptions that refactor messages are related to maintainability.
      \item Having few refactor messages (relative to the number of lines of code) means we have a smaller number of code smells. This is good for our architecture and quality!
      \item These low ratios may be a impacted by the data set we chose; perhaps open source projects with highly engaged communities tend to keep their code in a maintainable state, because this would be the only way for many people (over 90 contributors per project) to be involved.
      \item It has been interesting to see how low the ratio of refactor messages has been in our data set.

      \item This Radon score can range from 0 (awful) to 100 (perfect).
      \item Remember that Radon considers any value above 20 to be an ``A'' or ``very maintainable''.
      \item We can see that all of our projects receive an ``A'' grade, with the majority in the middle of the range (around 40 to 50).
      \item All projects in our data set were all mid- to high-range scores.

  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Structural quality impacts software evolution.
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Good projects will grow and evolve.
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Poor structure leads to deprecation.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If the development community is engaged, deprecation of 
        \newline the project may lead to a fresh, improved code base.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Open source and projects with many contributors are vulnerable to degrading maintainability.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Popular repositories with a long history of commits and releases 
        \newline (i.e. our repository data set) tend to have good maintainability.
      \item The high maintainability is a testament to their longevity.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Conclusions Notes -----------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\footnotesize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item From our set, the very best and very worst repositories are all still actively being improved and evolving, even today.
      \item An exception to this is our ``worst'' repository, raven-python, which was deprecated (this means the code is no longer supported), but in exchange for an improved system.
      \item The raven-python community didn't actually die, but the instead recognized that a better architecture was needed for the system to continue to evolve; they built a new code system (Sentry-Python) and shifted support there, where they have a better architecture and ability to evolve.
      \item Open source systems, and any project with many contributors or have many changes are vulnerable to degrading quality. It's just the nature of change over time.
      \item However, when we review a set of popular repositories that already have a long history of commits (these repositories are still active and over 5 years old!), we find that they tend to have good maintainability.

  \frametitle{Recommendations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Good architecture is important for evolution.
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}    
    \item Reliable quality metric can be a useful way to measure maintainability, which promotes ability to evolve a project.
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Pick a set of standards to maintain good architecture 
    \newline even with a large, open source community.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Limit complexity as project changes and grows.
      \item SOLID principles.
      \item Keep it DRY.
      \item And other design patterns known to be best practice.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.35cm}
    \item Auto-enforce by using quality measurements for desired standards 
    \newline in the project's CI/CD pipeline.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% ----- Recommendations Notes -------------------------------------------------
\note{
  {\scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Where do we go from here?
      \item In regards to the data, we'd like to do more study to understand the correlation between the Pylint metrics and Maintainability Index in order to gain better insights into our assumptions.
      \item What we've found so far is a reinforcement of what many of us already know.
      \item Good architecture is important for software to be able to evolve.
      \item Reliable quality metrics can be helpful to keep an architecture ready for enhancements.
      \item Regardless of your code base, your team should understand what set of standards will work best for your software solution.
      \item Then auto-enforce these standards in your pipeline. This keeps everyone honest and will improve the ability to evolve your project.
      \item That is a high-level view of my research on how structural quality impacts software evolution.
      \item Thank you for your time and attention! Any questions?
